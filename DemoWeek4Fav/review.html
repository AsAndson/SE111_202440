            <p>My review of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> is that I very much love it! The graphic are very goodand I'm shocked they stuck with the story so much. I do wish they had the other story which is basically the same thing but thye protag is a girl and one of the chracters doesn't die. Their story made me so sad because they worked so hard to make things right and at the end they don't even get to have a better life.</p>

                <h4>Some <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> fun facts and trivia</h4>
                <p>
                    Fun Fact 1: Before this remake there was another remake called Portable.
                    Fun Fact 2: There is a DLC with Reload that is basically the end game and shows more about what happened after the protag and his friends save the world
                    Fun fact 3: The game is about 100 hours long with only one run which is the good ending. There is also the bad ending which where the world ends. Also the last ending which is also the good ending but everyone forgets what happened.
                    Fun Fact 4: There is a dog character in the game that is overpowered
